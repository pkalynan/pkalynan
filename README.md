Hi, I'm @pkalynan. I'm interested in software and statistics. I'm currently learning languages usually on Ubuntu particularly C++ and C and adapting to new concepts. I'm looking to collaborate on technical articles, how-to guides and other tutorial oriented content based on technology.
Reach me by messaging through GitHub.

Studied data analytics at a graduate level and data science at a certificate level. Mixtures of IT, Analytics and Statistics would sum up what I have studied. While my first degree was in Business, I have always been around technology.

Currently, I have been working on technical writing and applying knowledge/skills into my articles. I assist with web site design and Domain Name System information for a close contact of mine. I have published a few of my articles on Analytics Vidhya through Medium.com as well as particpated in Data Science Blogathon 5.

Sample topics include: Internet domain name system records, VirtualBox, Operating Systems, programming/coding for data sciences and other helpful applications.
Few pending topics currently in the works are: VirtualBox, Virtual Private Network (VPN), "Things you did not know you could do on a Windows Operating System", and Linux on Windows.
