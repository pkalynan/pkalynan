I cannot find reasonable excuses to stop studying...

* Introduction to PC Security (course) at University of Waterloo Professional Development (May 2021 - current)
* MicroBachelors Cybersecurity Student at NYUx (April 2021 - current)
* Master of Science in Data Analytics at Southern New Hampshire University (Global Campus - Online) (April 2018 - August 2020)
* Business 4-year Degree at Humber College (September 2011 - December 2015)

Why? For the time being: I am a Technical Article Writer. I love seeing accurate publications in the technical space with codes that actually work.

For what? Provided a relevant opportunity and did not let go. Could help others at the same time.
